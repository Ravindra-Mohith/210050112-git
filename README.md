hash funtion is completely about converting one form of text to other form.
its utility is to encrypt some passwords

./test.sh <somestring>

returns a hashvalue

alias sizeOfFiles='du -a |wc -l'
i used piping to generdate the number of files 

alias numberOfFiles='du -a --human-readable'
--human-readable converts to readable format.

i used google chrome ryans tutorial to bash to learn this
